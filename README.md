# What is FlashyBird?

**FlashyBird has currently been taken down for the time being as it is undergoing a major refactor**

FlashyBird is an Intelligent FlashCard Generator that supports 12 languages. A teacher simply has to add words into the database and a student that logons will have flashcards automatically generated into their respective language. This is especially handy in a classroom setting where students have different first languages.
